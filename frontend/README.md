# Building a MPA application

Look at the code, it's pretty easier.

The most important part, is the `vue.config.js`.

At dev env, you could install `nodemon` to watch changes in your `vue.config.js`.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
